For the third experiment, I chose to create a concrete poetry project. The poem I used was *First Dog In Space* by Brennig Davies, which is about Laika, a stray dog from the streets of Moscow who was sent into space, starting the space race. I chose this poem because I've always felt drawn to the animals sacrificed in the space race (of which Laika is the best known, sometimes referred to as the patron saint of one-way trips).

I attempted to place the words of the poem in such a way that it looked like a dog jumping to catch a blue ball (referencing the refrain of "They say that, from space/ the Earth looks like a/ small, blue ball") and a rocket blasting off next to it. The ball Laika is jumping for is blue, her collar is red, the rocket has a red cone and fins with orange "fire" coming out of it.

*First Dog in Space, Brennig Davies*

They say that, from space,
the Earth looks like a
small, blue ball, but how
did it look to you, Laika?
From that shuttle like a balloon
whose string they let go, and which
they never trained for recall?

They say you were a stray
who never fought with other dogs,
and that the clever people called you pet names
through the wires of your shrinking cages,
and that, before you died, overheating
in that heavy, weightless cold, one of them
took you home, and you played with his kids.

They say that, from space,
the Earth looks like
a small, blue ball. I'll throw it
for you Laika, if you'll chase it,

dart through the stratosphere
like a comet, undeserving
of its fate
