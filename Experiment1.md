# Space Clock
For the first experiment, the brief I chose to follow was: *An alternative visual way to represent a realtime clock.*
The way I chose to do this was to have three spheres representing the three planets closest to the Sun (Mercury, Venus, and Earth) orbiting a fourth sphere representing the Sun. Mercury, the grey, smallest sphere, represents seconds and will make a full orbit of the Sun every 60 seconds. Venus, the beige, middle-sized sphere, represents minutes and will complete a full orbit every 60 minutes. Earth, the largest of the three spheres, coloured blue and green, represents hours and complete a full orbit every 24 hours.

When coming up with the idea for this code, I bounced ideas back and forth with some classmates, trying to think of things that could represent numbers or the hands of a clock without *being* either of those. As might be evident from my choices of experiments and decisions made across other modules, I have a great love for space, I have for a long time, and the idea of orbit taking the place of a clock's hands was the only idea with which I felt I could push myself beyond what we learned in class. I chose to make my model solar system (only the Sun and first three planets) in 3d because 2d wouldn't capture what was in my head. Sometimes an idea drives you to learn new skills to make it a reality, and this was one of those for me. Though I could have added lighting to make it look even better, perhaps. The three planets are each created with variations of the same function, taking different values for size of the planet, size of its orbit, colours, and the segment of time it represents. I considered using a modulus function to smooth the movement of the planets, but was honestly too nervous to risk breaking my clock. Out of the three experiments, this is the one I am proudest of.

When writing the code, I had some in-class help from Dave Webb, my professor, when learning 3d shapes in p5.js and camera angles, as these were topics we did not cover in class. There was also a period of time where I was struggling to get the inbuilt functions of second(), miunte(), and hour() to fit in my experiment, due to the fact that the three planet spheres are created using the same function with different parameters, and I received in-class advice on this as well. Aside from this, all the code is my own.
