# Space Clock
For the first experiment, the brief I chose to follow was: *An alternative visual way to represent a realtime clock*
The way I chose to do this was to have three spheres representing the three planets closest to the Sun (Mercury, Venus, and Earth) orbiting a fourth sphere representing the Sun. Mercury, the grey, smallest sphere, represents seconds and will make a full orbit of the Sun every 60 seconds. Venus, the beige, middle-sized sphere, represents minutes and will complete a full orbit every 60 minutes. Earth, the largest of the three spheres, coloured blue and green, represents hours and complete a full orbit every 24 hours.

When writing the code, I had some in-class help from Dave Webb, my professor, when learning 3d shapes in p5.js and camera angles, as these were topics we did not cover in class. There was also a period of time where I was struggling to get the inbuilt functions of second(), miunte(), and hour() to fit in my experiment, due to the fact that the three planet spheres are created using the same function with different parameters, and I received in-class advice on this as well. Aside from this, all the code is my own.
