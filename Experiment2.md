# Mouse Forcefield
For the second experiment, the brief I chose to follow was: *Mouse disturber - a 'force field' from the mouse changes or moves an arrangement of shapes when the mouse is near or over them. Create three different variations of behaviour.* The three variations of behaviour in my experiment, all relative to the positions of the mouse on the screen, are angle, size, and colour.
The rectangles, created using OOP, turn to face where the mouse is. Moving the mouse left and right or up and down alters the dimensions of the rectangles. Similarly, moving the mouse also changes the colours of the rectangles, but the colour of each individual rectangle is related to its own x and y coordinates.

I used [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lCD9B4Dlik&t=459s) as the basis for this experiment, as I had no prior experience with OOP in js. I am not sure if my code is distinct enough from the base, however I did alter the equations, added the colour change, and made it so the size variable is dependent on the window size.

I could have improved this by having individual rectangles change size instead of them all changing size/shape in the same way. Overall, I completed this particular experiment while handling some medical difficulties, so I consider it quite poor as a result, especially as I would have liked it to be more original.

I would have liked to do particle physics. I plan to do so in my free time.
